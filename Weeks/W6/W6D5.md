 Explain Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm. What algorithm does this remind you of? What's the difference?
 Explain floats and clears
 Explain the clearfix

 What might you want to store in each node in your Trie?
 How do you handle it when your Trie becomes too large to be stored on one machine?
 How would you collect and update the top results for a certain node in the Trie?
